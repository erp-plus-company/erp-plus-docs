# ERP Plus System Overview

ERP Plus is a modular multi-account ERP platform built as a **modular monolith using Rails Engines**.

Its design follows strict boundaries, clear ownership per module, and a scalable architecture intended to support long-term enterprise growth.

---

## System Philosophy

ERP Plus is built on 5 core principles:

### 1. Modular Monolith Architecture

The system is a single Rails application composed of isolated engines.

Each engine is:

- self-contained
- domain-focused
- independently maintainable

---

## Delivery Model

ERP Plus separates planning, implementation, and deployment into specialized platforms.

### Planning Layer

Planning is managed in Taiga.

Taiga contains:

- Epics
- User Stories
- Tasks
- Issues
- Sprints

### Implementation Layer

Implementation is managed in GitHub.

GitHub contains:

- branches
- commits
- pull requests
- releases

### Deployment Layer

Deployment is managed through:

- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Kamal

---

## End-to-End Flow

Every feature follows:

```txt
Epic (optional)
      ↓
User Story
      ↓
Task
      ↓
Branch
      ↓
Pull Request
      ↓
Review
      ↓
Merge
      ↓
Deploy
```

This workflow guarantees traceability from planning through production.

---

### 2. Engine Isolation

Engines must NOT:

- directly depend on internal implementation of other engines
- share business logic implicitly
- bypass defined interfaces

Communication MUST happen through:

- public services
- APIs
- domain contracts

---

### 3. Multi-Tenancy First

The system is designed to support multiple account from day one.

Tenancy rules apply across:

- authentication
- data access
- business logic
- background jobs

---

### 4. Infrastructure-Aware Design

ERP Plus is designed to run in production using:

- Docker
- Kamal deployments
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- PostgreSQL
- Redis-backed services (Solid Stack)

---

### 5. Security by Default

Security is not optional:

- secrets never live in repo
- CI includes Brakeman scanning
- dependency updates are automated
- deployment is protected
- engines must respect data boundaries

## Engine Communication Model

Engines interact using strict rules:

### Allowed:

- calling public services
- using shared interfaces
- event-based communication (future)

### Forbidden:

- direct model access across engines
- cross-engine business logic leakage
- tight coupling via internal classes

---

## System Roles (Mental Model)

ERP Plus assumes these system actors:

### Backend Developer

- builds engines
- defines domain logic
- owns APIs

### Frontend Developer

- consumes engine outputs
- builds UI via APIs
- does NOT touch domain rules

### DevOps Engineer

- owns CI/CD pipelines
- manages deployments
- monitors infrastructure

### QA Engineer

- validates behavior
- ensures regression safety
- tests engines independently

---

## Deployment Model

ERP Plus uses:

- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Docker containers
- Kamal deployment system

Flow:

`Code → PR → CI (test + security) → Merge → Deploy via Kamal`

---

## Scaling Strategy

ERP Plus scales by:

- adding new engines (not modifying core)
- keeping bounded contexts isolated
- enforcing strict CI rules
- avoiding cross-domain coupling

---

## Security Model

- secrets managed outside repo
- Brakeman static analysis in CI
- dependency updates via Dependabot
- protected branches (main/develop)
- audit-friendly deployment workflow

---

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is structured to serve:

- new developers
- external contributors
- DevOps engineers
- system maintainers

Each section of docs is designed for a different **audience lens**, not a different repo.

---

## Final Mental Model

ERP Plus is:

> A modular Rails platform where each engine behaves like a mini-product inside a controlled ecosystem.
