# 🧠 ERP Plus System Blueprint

This document is the **master blueprint of ERP Plus**, combining architecture, engines, data flow, and system design into a single mental model.

---

# 🧭 What is ERP Plus?

ERP Plus is a:

> Modular multi-account ERP platform built as a Rails modular monolith using Engines.

---

# 🧠 System Identity

ERP Plus is NOT:

- ❌ a monolith legacy app
- ❌ a microservices system
- ❌ a collection of independent engines

ERP Plus IS:

> a single coordinated system composed of isolated domain engines with strict contracts and controlled data flow.

# 🔄 System Flow (Unified Model)

Every action in ERP Plus follows this pattern:

```bash
Request
  → Authentication (erp_users)
  → Account Resolution (erp_accounts)
  → Authorization Layer
  → Domain Engine Execution
  → Optional Background Jobs (erp_workers)
  → Response
```

---

# 🔌 Engine System Model

Each engine behaves as:

> a bounded context inside a controlled monolith

## Engine Responsibilities

Each engine MUST:

- own its domain logic
- expose public services
- avoid internal leakage
- respect account boundaries

## Engine Isolation Model

```bash
erp_inventory ❌ cannot access erp_users internals
erp_workers ❌ cannot modify domain logic
erp_core ✔ shared utilities only
```

---

# 🧩 Communication Model

Engines communicate ONLY via:

## 1. Public Services

```ruby
ErpInventory::ProductService.create(...)
```

## 2. Domain Interfaces

Defined explicitly per engine.

## 3. Future: Domain Events

Planned evolution toward:

- event-driven architecture
- async cross-engine communication

---

# 🏢 Multi-Account Model

ERP Plus is account-first:

Every request is scoped by:

- organization
- account
- account context

```bash
User → Account → Data Scope → Engine Logic
```

---

# ⚙️ Execution Model

Domain logic is executed inside engines:

- synchronous for simple operations
- asynchronous via workers for heavy tasks

---

# 🔁 Background System

erp_workers handles:

- async jobs
- retries
- scheduled tasks
- heavy computations

Flow:

```bash
Engine → Job → Queue → Worker → Side Effect → Persistence
```

---

# 🔐 Security Model

Security is enforced at multiple layers:

- authentication (erp_core)
- account isolation (erp_accounts)
- authorization layer
- engine-level rules
- CI security scanning

---

# 📦 Infrastructure Model

ERP Plus runs on:

- Docker (local + production)
- Kamal (deployment)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- PostgreSQL (data)
- Solid Stack (jobs, cache, real-time)

---

# 🧠 System Design Principles

ERP Plus follows:

## 1. Isolation

Engines are independent bounded contexts.

## 2. Explicit Communication

No hidden coupling between engines.

## 3. Account-first Design

Everything is multi-account by default.

## 4. Infrastructure Awareness

System is designed for real production deployment.

## 5. Security by Default

Security is built into every layer.

---

# 🧠 Mental Model (MOST IMPORTANT)

Think of ERP Plus as:

```bash
A single system composed of isolated domain engines connected through controlled flows and strict contracts.
```

---

# 🚀 Scaling Model

ERP Plus scales by:

- adding new engines
- not modifying existing ones
- extending via services
- keeping strict boundaries

---

# 🧭 Final System View

```bash
User → Identity → Account → Domain Engine → Worker → Response
```

---

# 🧠 Final Statement

ERP Plus is:

> a controlled modular ecosystem where every engine behaves like a mini-product inside a single governed platform.
